h1. What is this site?

This is the home of software technologies that sprang into being from Adstream's in-house application development efforts. This is also
a window into the minds of our tech team, bringing forth the issues we found important, interesting or challenging in the course of our
work.

h1. Why have it?

Because, in its search for solutions, the Adstream's product development has grown more and more reliant on the wide world of the open source 
software and less and less on the stifling domain of the proprietary technologies. Because we have taken the best we found and 
rolled our own, and we want the latter to be as good as the former. Because we want *your* feedback. Because open source is cool. 

h1. How is this useful to me?

The tech is up for grabs: all libraries presented on this site are available under non-restrictive licenses for both commercial and non-commercial
use. They are also supported by the Adstream tech team: after all, this is the foundation we build our products on! We do try to keep our blog 
fresh and informative. The rest is up to you.
